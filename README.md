# Virtual Fitting Room Augmented Reality Technique
Hi everyone,
Myself Roshan Koirala, studying in the softwarica college of IT and Ecommerce. I have done research on topic "A qualitative research on Virtual Fitting Room Augmented Reality Technique" For this i have build a product which is an augmented reality fitting room where customer will be able to try items on their body.


Virtual Fitting Room is an augmented reality fitting room where the image of the user is captured by the webcam or any other camera and given as an input. By using the face and body detection techniques, the video is scanned for the presence of human faces and then product images are masked. Now the masked image is superimposed and the user can see the images of the dresses and face accessories on them self.

<h2>Project Setup Process :</h2>

Open project on python editor such as Pycharm and goto folder that contains main.py file and type python main.py and use it.
<h4>Thanks to all supporters to develop this system specially @pratikdhoryani -  github supporter.</h4>
